          I’ve lived in Shanghai, China for six months. Other
          than that, Bethlehem has been my hometown.</td>

          to markets and bargain a little bit, but now, once I
          came back here, I haven’t spoke it, so… I don’t know
          anymore. A few phrases, but that’s it.</td>

        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">I was in 4th grade, so I was pretty young,
          but I definitely want to go back because it’s always changing.
          Shanghai Tower, which I think is the 2nd tallest building in
          the world now? That was being built right outside my window,
          so I was able to see the foundation, and now it’s complete.
          I would like to go back and see it again.</td>

        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#66896b"><b>Have you traveled anywhere else?</b></td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">My family likes to travel into Europe a lot.
          I went into South Africa once, Botswana, Bolivia and Zimbabwe.
          We’re a big skiing family, so we like to go places, in Europe
          especially. Switzerland, Italy, France. So that’s been fun.
          Traveling’s been a big part of my life. I want to study abroad
          there, but I don’t know if it’s going to be possible now.</td>

        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#66896b"><b>What’s your major?</b></td>

      <tr>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#66896b"><b>Then how do you tie in Web Design in Product Design?</b></td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">[Web Design] is one of our studio lectures,
          but I was interested in Web Design, or trying to figure it
          out at least. Well, it’s like any other art class; it’s all
          part of the design process and how to make something more…
          appealing to the eye and make it catchier to the eye and have
          do what you’re trying to say. So that’s what I find interesting
          about design and Web Design especially, because looking at these
          new things, I’ve never particularly noticed them — the good websites.
          I haven’t realized how hard it is to figure all of that out. So
          getting a deeper dive is interesting to me.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#66896b"><b>Are you thinking about getting into a deeper career in product design?</b></td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">If I could, ideally, I’d like to design more, but
          that’s up for question now. I also like to do real estate, but I’m
          trying to keep my options open. I just saw the Design major and
          decided to pursue it.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#66896b"><b>if there is something you could do as a hobby that you can turn into a career, what could that be?</b></td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">Probably making music. I produce music. I started like 3 years ago.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#66896b"><b>What genre specifically?</b></td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">More like EDM. I have a program in here [my laptop].
          I don’t know how to play any instrument. Basically learned the basics
          of music theory and how to create chords and melodies, and then use
          sound design to make your unique sound. It’s very interesting. So
          pretty much anything in the design field is related. You build on it,
          you just keep on layering and layering it, and then once you’re done
          with the idea, you have to listen in and mix and master the sounds and
          have it sound the way you want it to. It’s kinda awesome. It’s like, I
          have this idea to make a song. Maybe no one else has done this type of
          stuff before, but to take someone else’s idea and put your own spin on
          it is interesting, so that’s why I think it’s interesting. So you can
          add your own touch that doesn’t exist before, but now you can see it
          come to life. </td>

          not very good, but I did come to Lehigh to play football.</td>

      <tr>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#66896b"><b>Oh, you mean in the Division 1 team?</b></td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">Yeah. But I stopped after my Freshman year.
          I came to play football, but I didn’t enjoy it as much.
          I played soccer my whole life, then moved on to football
          as a junior as a kicker. I didn’t enjoy it afterwards,
          but at least I get to say I played in a Division 1 team.
          I didn’t see the point, because… I mean school is… it’s a
          lot to have that on your back while you’re trying to do all
          this schoolwork.</td>

        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">What comes to mind is the Birdbox movie.
          It was the first time in Netflix where they used memes
          to advertise it, and I was like “What is this movie?
          They’re using memes to advertise?” I watched the movie,
          and it was god awful. It was the first time seeing a movie
          advertised primarily through memes and it made me irritated.
          I mean I watched it, so I guess it worked.</td>

        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#66896b"><b>Then what is your favorite movie?</b></td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">I can’t think one, but I do appreciate war movies
          based on true stories. I’d say American Sniper. It’s a pretty
          aggressive movie. It’s interesting to see what they see over there.
          You just see glimpses of what they see and it’s like it’s traumatic
          to even watch it on a screen and they had to experience it in real life.</td>

        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#66896b"><b>If you had to lose a sense in your body, what would it be?</b></td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">Probably smell. I feel like touch is important.
          Smell, I think you can get away without having it as much.
          It’s not not important, but I don’t want to lose sight or feel…</td>

        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#66896b"><b>What is challenging you currently in 2021?</b></td>
        <td valign="top" bgcolor="#4c6c50">I think it’s getting into the flow of going back into
          class in-person. It’s not too big of a deal, but it’s different now.
          I hated going into Zoom, so going into in-person classes makes me feel
          like I’m actually learning. But we’re still getting used to it, so
          maybe being what it used to be.</td>
